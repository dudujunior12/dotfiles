"Brilliant people shine more brightly than ordinary ones. They never regret or agonize over what they’ve done."
"I killed many people to act on my ideal. I killed so many that I stopped caring about innocent people and I saved a thousand times as many as I killed."
"Is it really worth saving this sad and ugly world, when there is nothing left after it is saved? With all this death, cruelty and sadness, do you still want to become a hero?"
"You can certainly fulfill your wish to “save someone”. But a wish for you to save yourself, does not exist. You will embrace a borrowed ideal that is not yours, and you will probably pursue it until you die."
"That’s all I wanted to say. There is nothing at the end of helping people. It is a false life that can save neither yourself nor others."
"Do not think about other things, there is only one thing you can do. So master that one thing. Do not forget. What you must imagine is always that you, yourself, are the strongest. You do not need outside enemies. For you, the one you have to fight is none other than your own image."
"Eternity is instantaneous, and an instant is eternal."
"It is at the moment of death that humanity has value."
"The wish of wanting everyone to be happy is merely a fairy tale!"
"An ideal is only an ideal after all. As long as you embrace that ideal, the friction with reality will continue to increase. So you will someday face reality and will have to pay the price for your compromises."
"I am the bone of my sword. Steel is my body, and fire is my blood. I have created over a thousand blades. Unknown to death. Nor known to life. Have withstood pain to create many weapons. Yet, those hands will never hold anything. So as I pray, ‘Unlimited Blade Works’"
